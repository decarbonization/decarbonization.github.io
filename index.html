        <h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
        <p>
            Our phones, tablets, and computers come with apps for lifestyle tasks like looking up the weather and taking
            notes. These apps are indispensible but they are designed to lock you into a manufacturer's ecosystem. They
            are built on proprietary platform-specific technologies and typically do not offer a smooth way to move your
            data and settings elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Just the Good Parts project is a collection of apps that disrupts that lock in by building on
            cross-platform web technologies and offering full control and portability over your data and settings.
        </p>

        <h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            Every app in this project is released as free software under the <a
                href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">GPL v3 license</a>. This ensures that any
            improvements to the apps are made available to other users.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any libraries built to support the apps in this project are released under an extremely permissive <a
                href="https://opensource.org/license/mit-0">MIT license</a>. Hacking and crazy projects encouraged.
        </p>
        <p>
            An unfortunate reality of the modern world is that daily tasks often depend on proprietary services, such as
            getting information about the weather. While the apps and libraries in this project are F/OSS, they make the
            pragmatic choice to use proprietary services when required to provide utility to the user.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Note:</b> As these proprietary services tend to come and go, it is expected that Just the Good Parts apps
            will have to migrate to different services during their lifetime as actively maintained projects.
